# Click Between Frames (CBF) 🎮✨

**Developer**: Nyxian  
**Description**: Click Between Frames (CBF) is a mod designed to improve input handling in Geometry Dash by allowing inputs to register between frames. This drastically increases input precision, especially on lower framerates like 60FPS. It's similar to TPS Bypass or Draw Divide but with less lag and fewer physics-related bugs.
